## Overview
### What is Perspective?
Originally developed for J.P. Morgan's trading business, Perspective is
an *interactive* visualization component for *large*, *real-time*
datasets.  Use it to build reports, dashboards, notebooks and applications.

Perspective comes with:

- A fast, memory efficient streaming query engine, written in C++ and compiled to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), with read/write/stream support for [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org).
- A framework-agnostic query configuration UI component, based on [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/), and a WebWorker and/or WebSocket data engine host for stable interactivity at high frequency.
- A suite of simple, context-aware visualization plugins for some common Javascript libraries such as [D3FC](https://d3fc.io/) and [Hypergrid](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core).
- Integration with [JupyterLab]( https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io)Jupyterlab, Runtimes for the Browser and Node.js.
